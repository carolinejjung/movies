# Investigating Gender Imbalance in 50 Hollywood Movies 
This project started out as a class project (CS 230 Data Structures) at Wellesley College under the instruction of the CS department professors. With the help of tutors and professors as well as two other teammates, we were able to write a report ranking 50 Hollywood movies on sufficient female representation using Java.

This project used real world data to investigate the gender imbalance in a set of 50 Hollywood movies. The film industry is a largely male-dominant field. Using a series of tests designed by women in the film industry, our code parsed through the data to find which movies have sufficient female representation on and off screen. The thirteen tests analyze different components of a movie to determine whether a movie passes or not, including behind the scenes crew, intersectionality, and the cast. We defined a feminist score as a movie that passes the Bechdel Test, Rees-Davies Test, Ko Test, Pierce Test, and Keoze-Dottle Test (for more information about these tests, read more [here](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/next-bechdel/)). These tests combined define what we consider the “bare-minimum” for a feminist movie. Each test has a different weight in our scoring system. If a movie passes all five of these tests, as well as any additional tests, we will consider those as well. The highest score a movie can have is 108, with 100 meaning it passed all five of the tests we selected.
